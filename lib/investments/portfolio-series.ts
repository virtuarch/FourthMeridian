/**
 * lib/investments/portfolio-series.ts  (SD-4 FU-CHART)
 *
 * The canonical "Portfolio Value Over Time" series for the Investments Workspace —
 * built by REUSING the already-persisted SpaceSnapshot per-date series (the same
 * authority Wealth reads), NOT by sampling getInvestmentValueAsOf across dates
 * (an N×date DB path) and NOT by reconstructing from today's holdings.
 *
 * BUCKET RULE (preserves the doctrine "shared PositionObservation spine ≠ shared
 * net-worth bucket", and avoids the historical BTC double-count): the Investments
 * Workspace portfolio is brokerage + crypto, so each point's value is
 *   totalInvestments (SpaceSnapshot.stocks — investments EXCLUDING crypto)
 *   + totalCrypto     (SpaceSnapshot.crypto  — the separate digital-asset column)
 * i.e. two DISJOINT historical buckets summed = each asset counted exactly ONCE.
 * We never sum `stocks` with a crypto-INCLUDED valuation (that double-counts), and
 * never plot `stocks` alone (that silently drops crypto).
 *
 * Honesty: `fxMiss` points (a snapshot whose mixed-currency total couldn't be
 * converted) are DROPPED — a shorter honest series over a silently mixed one, the
 * same rule the net-worth hero uses. `estimated` (reconstructed / display-estimated)
 * rides through per point.
 *
 * Pure — no DB, no prisma. The route gathers the snapshots (getRecentSnapshots) and
 * hands them here; this module only reshapes + (optionally) display-converts.
